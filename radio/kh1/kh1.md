## INTRODUCTION

The Elecraft KH1 is a pocket-sized, 40/30/20/17/15 meter, low-power CW transceiver optimized for handheld as well as table-top operation. The transceiver itself weighs only 6 oz. (0.17 kg); with internal battery and all options installed, total weight is 13 oz. (0.36 kg). This allows it to be operated HT-style indefinitely without causing arm or wrist fatigue. It's also an ideal backup rig, requiring little packing space.

The KH1's unique form-factor provides multiple advantages for field operation:

USER INTERFACE Both the knobs and optional keyer paddle (KHPD1) are at the lower end of the transceiver. This is ideal when you're sitting or standing, holding the radio with one hand while operating it with the other. The four pushbutton switches are close by, aligned with LCD text fields.

FIELD LOGGING The KHLOG1 fold-out log tray solves one of the most vexing problems with SOTA, HF Pack, and general field operation: how to conveniently log contacts, in any situation. The tray can be installed on either side of the radio, facilitating left- or right-handed use, and protects the front panel when closed. Filled log sheets can be moved to the bottom of the stack with one hand..

BUILT-IN WHIP The KHATU1 antenna tuner comes with a modified top panel that embodies a whip mounting screw, loading coil, and band-selection switch for use on 20/17/15 meters (and on 30 meters with reduced efficiency). The supplied telescoping whip clips to the side of the rig when not in use. The ATU matches a wide range of loads, and works with the BNC jack as well as the whip.

The KH1 covers the full frequency range of each ham band, with power output of 5 watts. Many hours of field operation are ensured by an internal 2.6 AH, 11 V Li-ion battery (KXBT2). An internal charger (KHIBC1) keeps the battery topped off, ready to go when you are.

The KH1 has many other features, including:

· small speaker

· optional right-angle adapter for the whip (model #KHRA1)

· real-time clock (RTC), including both time and date

· SWL band: 6.7 - 22.0 MHz (uses SSB mode to copy AM); ATU can be manually tuned to peak signals

· CW text decode/display, plus 50 K of EEPROM for logging TX text and CW-entered field notes

· VFO locking; RIT and XIT

· SSB/CW cross-mode operation

· Easy-to-use scan/mini-pan function for signal hunting

· firmware upgrades via supplied USB cable and KH1 Utility application

· full remote control for specialized applications

· custom, zippered carrying case (ES20) with utility pockets (pg. 13)

We hope the KH1 becomes your go-to rig for ultralight adventure travel - whether to exotic locales, to the urban/wilderness boundary, or just to your own back yard.

Wayne, N6KR Eric, WA6HHQ

## GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

· DO NOT PLUG A KXUSB CABLE INTO THE HEADPHONE JACK. The KXUSB cable (used for firmware updates) must be plugged only into the KEY/DATA jack. See 24 for firmware update instructions.

· Do not touch the telescoping whip when transmitting, as you could receive an RF burn. Set the whip's band switch to the center-off position when using the BNC jack. (A telescoping whip and internal matching components are supplied with KHATU1 option.)

· Avoid prolonged exposure to moisture . The KH1 can be used in light precipitation, but it is not waterproof. If the log tray is installed, it can be folded over the front panel for moisture resistance.

## POWER SOURCE

## EXTERNAL SUPPLY

An 8-15 V low-noise power supply, solar panel, or battery can be connected to the external supply jack on the left side. The center pin is (+), as is the white-striped wire on the supplied power cable. The plug can be a Switchcraft model S760 or similar (2.1 mm pin aperture, 5.5 mm barrel diameter).

Power output varies with supply voltage. On all bands, maximum power output when running from 11 V is typically 5 watts into a 50 ohm load. (See MENU:ADJ PWR .)

The internal and external DC jacks are identical, and are diode-isolated from each other. The jack with the higher voltage will power the transceiver. For example, if you have an internal battery pack plugged in that measures 10.5 V, and an external supply also plugged in that measures 12 V, the external source will supply power. (To display supply voltage and current, see MENU:DISP MODE . A more accurate display of internal battery voltage, along with an amp-hours meter, is also available. See MENU:VBAT .)

## CHARGE STATUS LED

A small LED near the power switch provides power-on and charge status indications, as follows.

## With a standard KHDC1 DC input module installed (no charger module):

· LED is GREEN when the KH1 is ON; UNLIT when it is OFF. (Regardless of which DC jack is in use.)

## With a KHIBC1 internal battery charger installed:

· With no external supply connected: the LED is GREEN when the KH1 is ON; UNLIT when it is OFF.

· With an external operating/charging supply connected: the LED is RED when the radio is OFF and charging; ORANGE when the radio is ON and charging; GREEN when charge is complete and the radio is ON; UNLIT when charge is complete and the radio is OFF.

See important cautions on next page regarding charging the battery internally or externally.

## INTERNAL BATTERY

The KH1 is designed to use an Elecraft KXBT2 lithium-ion battery pack. This pack is rated at 11 V, 2.6 Ah. Thanks to the KH1's low receive-mode current drain (~50 to 80 mA), the KXBT2 can provide full power output (5 watts) for 4 to 12 hours of typical QRP operation, and up to 50 hours receive-only.

The battery pack can be internally recharged at a C/10 rate (~250 mA) using a KHIBC1 internal charger. In this case, charging voltage (nominally ~14 V, minimum 12 V) is provided by the same supply that operates the radio. A KXBC2 external fast-charger can also be used (see cautions below.)

CAUTION: IF A KHIBC1 INTERNAL BATTERY CHARGER IS INSTALLED, DO NOT USE ANY BATTERY PACK OTHER THAN THE KXBT2 , which has built-in protection circuitry. The use of an incompatible battery pack may be unsafe and may void the warranty.

CAUTION: THE BATTERY PACK MUST BE REMOVED FOR RECHARGING WHEN USING A KXBC2 FAST CHARGER. Fast chargers generate RFI, and are NOT suitable for internal charging or for radio operation.

Follow the steps below to install or remove the battery pack.


<!-- image -->

The aluminum back cover has a tab that forms a hinge with the plastic top panel. Once the back cover has been rotated to a perpendicular position, slide its metal tab backward about 1/8" (3 mm) before continuing rotation. This will make it easier to close the back cover.

· Before installing or removing the battery, turn the KH1 OFF using the small slide switch near the external supply jack. The OFF setting is AWAY from the jack.

· Release the KH1's back panel using the sliding thumb latch near the knobs ( red arrow ). Then lift open the back cover, sliding it backward while rotating the metal tab through the hinge.

· Plug the battery pack into the internal DC jack. Make sure the plug is inserted up to its shoulder.

· Place the battery into position, then dress the excess wire to the side approximately as shown.

· Slide the thumb latch out of the way of the back panel's tab, then secure the panel.

When unplugging the battery, always use the plastic pull tab. Also press lightly where shown by the blue arrow to ensure that the internal charger or DC input module does not come unplugged due to excessive plug extraction force.

The back cover can be completely removed if desired via a thin slot at the back of the plastic hinge.

The KH1 includes an amp-hour metering function that allows you to better estimate remaining battery life. See pg. 23.

## PRESERVING CLOCK TIME DURING CHARGING

The KH1 includes a real-time clock (RTC), useful for logging (see MENU:LOGGING ). RTC circuitry is powered by the battery or power supply (internal or external).

When no power supply or battery is connected, the RTC's time registers are preserved for about 1 minute by a large-value capacitor. This allows sufficient time to swap batteries without losing the time setting.

## UTILITY MOUNTING POINTS

To enhance versatility, the KH1 provides several utility mounting holes that could be used for future Elecraft accessories or for user-supplied hardware. These are located in three places (see arrows below).


<!-- image -->

BACK COVER, MIDDLE: There are two #2 flat head screw holes in the middle of the back cover. The screw heads must go on the inside , and must be flat head to clear the Li-ion battery pack.

BACK COVER, SIDES: There are two #2 holes on each side of the back cover. These are intended for use with the whip mounting clips that are supplied with the KHATU1 option, though they could be used as attachment points for other hardware. Pan head screws must be used in these locations, with the heads on the inside . Any other hardware on the inside (such as a nut or washer) would interfere with circuitry.

LOG TRAY: The KHLOG1 log tray (discussed in the next section) has holes at each corner. Some operators may wish to use one of these as an anchor point for a pen lanyard, guarding against loss of the pen when dropped. (A lanyard should not be needed with the supplied mini ball-point pen, however, as it clips securely to the log tray.)

## LOG TRAY AND PEN

The KHLOG1 log tray option makes it easy to log contacts while standing, walking, sitting on a trail or rock, or in other situations where there's no convenient writing surface. Such situations occur often during field use. Sometimes sitting is impossible due to insects, mud, thorns, or other impediments.


<!-- image -->

## To use the log tray:

· To open the tray, press with a thumb at the locations indicated by the red arrows above, then fold the tray open. The rails also slide out to provide additional clearance for your fingers when operating the KH1 hand-held. Detent locking keeps the tray open, even when upside-down.

· The tray can be moved to the either side of the radio. To remove it, push upward on the rails as shown by the blue arrows above, lifting as you pull the rails out. To reinstall, squeeze the forked ends as you insert them into the provided slots.

· Print out and precisely trim the desired number of log pages from the file KH1LOGSHEETS.PDF, available on our KH1 web page. We recommend keeping 8 to 10 sheets in the tray, as this stack thickness will provide a moderate friction fit within the upper and lower paper guides.

· Unclip the supplied mini ball-point pen to log contacts, record field observations, etc. Note: If you use a Space Pen instead, remove its metal pocket clip and/or cap to allow it to fit.

· To change log sheets, slide one sheet off the top, then insert it under the stack, starting with one corner. Indentations are provided for this purpose at the locations near the red arrows . With practice you'll find this can be done with one hand.

· When operating at night, fold the log tray halfway up to let the LCD backlight illuminate the log.

## ANTENNAS

The basic KH1 has a BNC jack intended for use with a 50 ohm load, e.g. a resonant dipole, vertical, or endfed half-wave. Further information on antennas can be found in the ARRL Antenna Handbook and other sources.

Since a basic KH1 does not include the whip, hole plugs are installed at the mounting post and switch.

## BUILT-IN ATU AND WHIP MATCHING NETWORK

The ATU option (KHATU1) greatly enhances the KH1's versatility. It includes:

· an automatic antenna tuner unit (ATU) that works with both the BNC jack and whip

· internal whip-matching network for use on 20/17/15 meters (30 m at higher SWR / lower power)

· telescoping whip, plus two clips that retain the whip on the side of the KH1 when not in use

· 13' counterpoise wire suitable for 30-15 m use (with the ATU)

Like the log tray, the plastic whip clips can be installed on either side of the transceiver, facilitating leftor right-handed operation. Refer to instructions on our KH1 manuals web page.


<!-- image -->

## To use the BNC jack:

· Set the whip band switch to the center-off position (" x ") to remove RF from the whip mounting post.

· The ATU may provide a better SWR, as well as allowing operation on multiple bands. See pg. 18.

## To use the built-in whip:

· Unclip the whip from the radio.

· Screw it to the mounting post.

· Set the slide switch to the 20 m or 17/15 m position. (This does not disconnect the BNC jack from the ATU. It is always connected. )

· Match the whip using the ATU.

· Operation on 30 m is possible in the 20 m switch position. SWR may be high and power output reduced.

· Attach the supplied counterpoise wire to the ground screw, and deploy the wire (on the ground, across bushes, etc.).

· Refer to operating tips on next page.

It is normal for the whip mounting post to have some "play" when a whip is not connected. The post is pinned internally so that it cannot rotate or be extracted. When a whip is attached, it will be very rigid and stable.

## TIPS FOR USING COMPACT ANTENNAS

The built-in whip can be deployed in seconds and takes very little storage space. It allows your entire KH1 multi-band station to disappear into a small pocket. However, a whip will not be as efficient as a longer antenna mounted well above ground.

Rising to this challenge is half the fun...and the tips below can improve your QSO rate. It's possible to make long-range DX contacts using low power and a whip, especially with advantageous propagation. Contacts of 1,000 to 2,000 miles are quite common.

## To enhance communications effectiveness when using a whip:

· ALWAYS use a counterpoise wire. Without one, your transmitted signal strength will be as much as 20 to 30 dB lower at receiving stations, even if you get an apparent good match using the ATU.

· Bring extra wire for outings when band conditions are rough. If there are trees available, a random-wire antenna can be quickly deployed, then matched using the ATU. A BNC-to-binding post adapter (e.g. Elecraft #BNC-BP) can be used to attach an antenna wire to the BNC jack.

· Choose locations with an upward slope behind you . This can work as a reflector.

· Arrange your ground counterpoise wire for greatest benefit. Deploying the wire toward the favored direction often improves signal strength by several dB, as can draping the wire on top of foliage. You can use the ATU to compensate for changes in wire position and terrain.

· Use the Reverse Beacon Network (RBN). This is a global network of receiving stations that may detect your signal and report it on their website. It's a great tool for optimizing antennas.

· Try working strong stations first (S7 or higher). While some stations may be strong due to amplification, more often it's because of favorable propagation. Also, they typically use low-loss antennas with gain, making them louder - while allowing them to hear you better as well.

· Drop in on the QRP "watering holes. " There are QRP calling frequencies, such as 14060.0 kHz, that are used for weak-signal CW work. "HF Pack" operators will often monitor or call on 18157.5 kHz and other standard HF pack frequencies in both SSB or CW modes. Another active group that listens for weak signals is the County Hunters Net , around 14055 kHz.

· Plan outings around times when band activity is high, including weekday evenings, weekends, and whenever contests are in progress. Contest examples: CQ DX, ARRL CW, and other "majors"; ARRL Field Day, Winter Field Day (WFD) and other contests emphasizing QRP/field operation; and CWT (very active weekday CW operating events put on by the CWops organization).

· Try SOTA (Summits On The Air) and POTA (Parks On The Air) operation. These activities are very popular. SOTA in particular uses a limited frequency range and in most cases low power. "Chasers" (SOTA) or "hunters" (POTA) will be looking for you, and your outings can be pre-announced using self-spotting tools like RBNhole. Our model KHRA1 right-angle adapter is ideal for POTA/table-top operation. See KHRA1, below.

## KHRA1 RIGHT-ANGLE WHIP ADAPTER

Quick-deployment table-top operation of the KH1 and its whip is faclitated by our model KHRA1 right-angle whip adapter. The adapter includes a built-in "bipod." As shown in the images below, its two legs fold up for transport, or outward to stabilize the rig and antenna in a breeze. (Whip is shown collapsed.)

Note that this adapter is not applicable the BNC jack - only to the whip. For right-angle mounting of BNC antennas such as our AX1 or AX2, you can use our model AXB1 bipod and a right-angle BNC adapter.


<!-- image -->

## GROUND CONNECTION AND COUNTERPOISE WIRE

A counterpoise wire can be secured to the KH1 using the ground screw beside the BNC jack. The wire can be wrapped around the KH1 and left attached to the ground screw to enable quick deployment.

The KHATU1 option is supplied with a 13' counterpoise wire suitable for use on 20-15 meters. The ATU can be used to achieve resonance and compensate for varying wire lengths, heights, and terrain.

The ATU option also comes with two plastic "whip clips" that double as attachment points for the free ends of antenna or ground wire, as well as headphone cables. The arrow in the illustration below-left highlights the serrated gap on one of the whip clips. A wire or thin cable inserted into this gap will be securely retained during transport.

<!-- image -->

## SPARE GROUND NUT

If the regular ground thumb nut becomes lost, the supplied spare ground nut can be used. This 4-40 hex nut is stored inside the enclosure near the on-offswitch, as shown by the arrow in the illustration at aboveright. This nut can be pried upward out of its retaining clip using any small tool, including the paddle hex wrench, which is stored nearby (see KEY/DATA JACK, pg. 13).

Turn the KH1 OFF when removing the spare ground nut or hex wrench.

## CARRYING CASE

The ES20 custom carrying case is shown below (actual color is black). It provides safe storage for the KH1, headphones, spare battery packs, antenna wire, whip, and other small accessories. The ES20's numerous straps, two D rings, and carabiner add attachment versatility. For example, it can be worn on a belt, vertically. With one hand, the zippered main pocket can then be opened and the radio extracted.


<!-- image -->

## KEY/DATA JACK

A keying device fitted with a 3.5 mm (1/8") stereo plug can be plugged into the KEY/DATA jack. This jack doubles as serial port for firmware updates and remote control (see next page).

The optional KHPD1 keyer paddle is designed specifically for hand-held operation. It plugs directly into the KEY/DATA jack in the orientations shown below. At left, the KHPD1 is shown in its stored position. At center, the paddle is shown deployed, out of the way of the AF GAIN and VFO knobs.

Be sure to insert the paddle's plug all the way, so that it snaps into the jack. The paddle's PC board must be resting on the two plastic nubs to the left and right of the jack.


<!-- image -->


<!-- image -->

Contact spacing of the KHPD1 paddle can be adjusted using the hex wrench stored inside the enclosure (see arrow in the illustration above-right). Each paddle has a set screw in its housing. A fairly wide spacing is recommended for operation in high-vibration or less-stable operating positions.


<!-- image -->

Turn the KH1 OFF when removing or replacing the hex wrench.

## DATA CONNECTION

The KEY/DATA jack doubles as a serial interface port for upgrading firmware, via the supplied KXUSB cable and our KH1 Utility software application. ( MENU:KEY JACK must be set to RS232; the KXUSB cable converts this to USB. The serial interface data rate is fixed at 9600 baud.)

The KH1's user interface can be fully remote-controlled through the KEY/DATA port, using a terminal emulator or custom software application. This capability is intended for factory alignment use, but it could also be used for special applications. (For a list of remote-control commands, refer to the Elecraft KH1 Programmer's Reference. )

When the KEY/DATA jack is being used for remote control, it is not available for use with a keying device. However, there's a remote-control command (HK) that can be used to simulate CW keying, as if using a hand key. This command is used during factory alignment. It could also be used for on-air CW transmission, replacing the key or paddle. The software application would be responsible for ASCII to CW translation and/or could provide its own keying input device.

## HEADPHONES AND SPEAKERS

The 3.5 mm PHONES jack accommodates headphones or an externally amplified speaker. A stereo plug must be used in all cases. If the log tray is installed on the same side as the headphone jack (which is the case for right-handed operators), a small-format, right-angle headphone plug will be needed to avoid interference with the log tray during operation.

Headphones are preferred when wind or other noise sources are present. However, the KH1 does include a small internal speaker, located on the bottom panel, between the two knobs.

When using the speaker, strong signals or high sidetone volume settings can cause a significant increase in average receive current drain. If this occurs, you can reduce AF gain or sidetone level.

## DISPLAY

The KH1 uses an alphanumeric LCD with two lines of 16 characters. The display is backlit at all times, consuming only 6 mA of current while making the display easily readable under any lighting conditions.

The KH1 FRONT PANEL QUICK REFERENCE (next page) shows the normal operating display. Subsequent sections show examples of all the different displays used.

With most switch functions, the LCD is divided into four columns that correspond to the four push-button switches below it. In such cases, the upper line of the LCD shows switch tap functions, while the lower line shows hold functions. (This is presented in detail on pg. 17.) Small white and yellow squares to the left of the display and switches serve as a reminder of this relationship.

## BASIC OPERATION

This section describes basic KH1 operation in tutorial fashion. We recommend trying each of the controls (summarized on pg. 15).

Before using the KH1, connect a power supply and antenna, at minimum. See pages 5 and 9.

## TURNING THE KH1 ON/OFF

To turn the KH1 on or off, use the small slide switch near the external supply jack on the left side. When you turn it on, the initialization screen should appear for about 2 seconds:

If there's an error message, refer to ERROR MESSAGES (pg. 36).

## SWITCH TAP AND HOLD FUNCTIONS

All KH1 switches have two functions:

· Tap to activate the function labeled above a switch, in white. Tap functions are denoted with a white box, e.g. SPD-.

· Hold for over 0.5 seconds to activate the function labeled below a switch, in yellow. This is shown by a black box, e.g. RCVR .

The four pushbutton switches are also referred to as 1 -4 (taps) or 1 -4 (holds) when they're used to perform functions shown on the display.

## VFO KNOB FUNCTIONS

The right-hand knob controls the VFO. Tapping this knob-i.e., briefly pushing it inwardalternates between 10 Hz and 100 Hz tuning steps. This is denoted as U VFO (a knob icon, plus a white box indicating a tap function).

The 100 Hz step size can be changed; see MENU:VFO FAST .

Holding the VFO knob in for over 0.5 seconds selects 1 kHz tuning steps ($_{U}$ 1 KHZ ) until the knob is tapped again to cancel.

When the BAND/MODE function is in use, the VFO knob moves the VFO in 100 kHz steps.

## AF/MON KNOB FUNCTIONS

The left-hand knob (AF/MON) normally controls AF gain ($_{U}$ AF ). As you rotate the knob, the new setting is displayed briefly on line 1 of the display.

Tapping the AF/MON knob switches to its$_{U}$ MON function (MONitor). Sidetone volume level is displayed on line 1 and sidetone pitch on line 2:

A U

M O N

0 3

V U

P I T C H

6 0 0

H z

The A U in line 1 indicates that the AF knob sets sidetone level. The V U in line 2 indicates that the VFO knob sets sidetone pitch. Tap any control to restore the AF gain function.

You may need to re-align the BFOs if you change the sidetone pitch. See MENU:ADJ BFO.

Holding the AF/MON knob switches to the receiver spotting function, or ($_{U}$ SPOT . This allows the VFO knob to be used to tune in a signal to match your sidetone pitch. SPOT will be shown on line 2 of the display until the spotting function is cancelled by any control tap.

## DISPLAY MAPPING TO SWITCHES 1-4

Functions shown on the display are often mapped to one or more of the pushbutton switches. This provides access to up to 8 functions, each with a single switch press: 4 via a tap , and 4 via a hold .

In the example below, T1 - T4 correspond to taps 1 -4 , and H1 - H4 correspond to holds 1 -4 .

## RECEIVER CONTROLS

After holding the RCVR switch, the LCD shows:

Tap 1 , 2 , or 3 to select filter bandwidths; tap 4 to exit without making changes. Hold 1 , 2 , or 3 selects attenuation levels; hold 4 to turn on RIT.

ATTENUATOR: When the attenuator is set to -10 dB, a resistor icon appears on line 2 (assuming MENU:DISP MODE is set to Operate):

1 4 Ø Ø Ø . Ø Ø

C

+ . Ø Ø

S Ø

1

Ø Ø : Ø Ø

The -30 dB setting uses a thicker resistor icon. In the 0 dB setting, the icon character is blank.

S-METER: The S-meter shows S0-S9 (6 dB/unit), then: "+" = S9+10, = S9+20, ‡ = S9+30.

RIT: When RIT is on, an R appears to the right of the RIT/XIT offset on line 1. The VFO knob then controls the RIT offset. The offset can be zeroed using a menu function (see MENU:RIT CLEAR ). RIT is used to change your receive frequency without affecting your transmit frequency - useful for fine-tuning stations after you call CQ.

## PFn AND TRANSMITTER CONTROLS

Holding PFn/XMTR shows 8 selections:

P F 1 P F 2 P F 3 [ x ] T U N P W R T S T X I T

Tap 1 , 2 , or 3 to execute a programmable function (see pg. 21). Tap 4 to exit.

Hold 1 to put the transmitter into TUNE mode. Hold 2 to select LO (~2 W) or HI (~5 W) power level (pg. 21). Hold 3 to put the transmitter into TX TEST mode, used for CW practice (no RF out).

XIT: Hold 4 to turn on XIT, which adds an X after the RIT/XIT offset. XIT offsets your transmit frequency without affecting your receive frequency. This is useful when calling DX stations who specify "UP 2" (etc.) when they call CQ.

## BAND AND MODE CONTROLS

Holding BAND/MODE brings up this display:

To change bands, tap 1 (-) or 2 (+). The last band, above 15 m, is used for general coverage (pg. 22). You can use the VFO knob to adjust frequency in 100 kHz steps while in the band/mode display.

To change modes, hold 1 (-) or 2 (+). Use SSB modes to copy AM. Also see SSB/CW CROSSMODE OPERATION, pg. 22.

Tap 3 (V/M) to exchange the present V FO frequency with the scratchpad M emory. Hold 3 (V>M) to copy the VFO to memory. The memory holds frequency, mode, and attenuator settings.

Tapping 4 exits. Holding 4 locks (or unlocks) the VFO. VFO locking is especially useful when negotiating rough terrain. Note: Lock applies to VFO and XIT, but not to RIT.

## KEYER SPEED CONTROLS

Tapping SPDor SPD+ changes the built-in keyer speed (8-50 WPM). This can be done while sending, including during message playback.

Slower code speeds (16-24 WPM) are recommended with QRP operation in general, and in particular when operating with small antennas and/or pedestrian mobile (/PM).

## ATU TUNING

Tapping ATU causes the antenna tuner, if installed, to look for the best match to the attached load. You'll hear relays switching for 1 to 4 seconds. The ATU settings are stored on a perband basis and recalled automatically when you change bands.

If SWR is very high (> 3:1) after matching with the ATU, consider making length or other adjustments to the antenna or counterpoise. Tap ATU again afterward. SWR is shown continuously on a bar graph as you key the transmitter. 1 solid block = close to 1:1, 2 blocks = 2:1, etc. Unfilled blocks indicate half of an SWR unit, so 1 solid and one unfilled would equate to about 1.5:1.

The miniature ATU module in the KH1 has fewer L and C components than in the Elecraft KX2 and KX3 ATUs. This means it will not always find a very low SWR. In most cases it will be under 3.0, which still ensures excellent power transfer. The transmitter's PA device is very resilient to even higher SWR values, and it can be operated into virtually any load. However, if reflected power is excessive, the KH1 will automatically drop into Low Power mode. (See MENU:ADJ PWR for details on setting power levels.)

The KH1 ATU does not need a "second-tap within five seconds" feature to try more L-C combinations. The ATU keeps trying until all combinations have been tested, or one is found that provides an SWR of 1:1.

## MESSAGE PLAY / RECORD CONTROLS

There are six message memories in two groups (1-3, 4-6). Messages can be recorded using the keyer paddle, then played back with or without repeat. They can also be individually cleared.


<!-- image -->

You can tap SPD-/ SPD+ during playback.

If text decode is turned on ( MENU:TEXT DEC ), message text will be decoded both as you enter it and as it is played back. If electronic logging is enabled ( MENU:LOGGING ), all transmitted text will be saved for later viewing or download.

All message operations start with a tap of MSG , which shows the following 8 functions:


| M 1   | M 2   | M 3   | [ x ]   |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| R P 1 | R P 2 | R P 3 | R E C   |

As shown above, tapping 1 -3 plays messages M1 -M3 . Holding 1 -3 plays with auto-repeat. MENU:MSG RPT sets the message repeat interval. In between repeated messages, a letter r flashes slowly to the right of the mode letter ( C ).

Holding 4 ( REC ) brings up the RECord functions:

To record message M1 -M3 , tap 1 -3 . This will show " RECORDING MSG n " on the LCD, at which point you can start sending with the keyer paddle. Up to 40 characters can be entered. End recording by tapping any switch.

Holding 4 ( GRP ) alternates between the two message groups (1-3 and 4-6).

To clear a message, hold 1 -3 (e.g., CL4 -CL6 ).

## USING THE MENU

The menu is not required for basic operation. However, it does provide access to advanced features, so we encourage you to review all menu entries after you become familiar with the basics.

To enter the menu, hold the MENU switch. This brings up the default menu entry, DISP MODE:

A U D I S P M O D E [ x ] V U O p e r a t e

The AF/MON knob is used to scroll through menu entries (shown by A U at the start of line 1). The VFO knob is used to change parameter values (V U ). To exit, tap 4 as indicated by [x] on line 1.

The DISP MODE menu entry selects the mode for line 2 of the display. The default mode is Operate , showing S-units, filter bandwidth, icons, and time. The alternate mode for line 2 is V/I/Temp , which shows the supply voltage, current drain, and PA device temperature in degrees C.

All alignment menu entries start with "ADJ" (short for "adjust"). They're at the top of the list.

Many menu entries are locked to prevent accidental parameter changes. This is indicated by a key symbol at the right end of the lower LCD row. To unlock, hold switch 4 .

## ADVANCED FEATURES

## SCAN/MINI-PAN

The KH1 includes a band-scanning function with visual display of signal level across the selected tuning range. This is especially useful for handsfree signal search when bands are quiet.

## Scan/mini-pan setup:

· Make sure the threshold comparator menu entry is set to the ideal value. See instructions at MENU:PAN THR .

· Tune the VFO to approximately the middle of the range of interest. For example, if you were monitoring 20 meters for SOTA activators or other QRP stations, you might set the VFO to 14060 kHz.

· Set MENU:PAN SPAN to the desired total scan range (default: 10 kHz). Smaller spans will provide a faster scan rate and better frequency resolution.

## Scan/mini-pan operation :

· Set MENU:PAN MODE to ON and exit the menu.

· The scan/mini-pan will appear. This captures the VFO, so normal tuning is disabled until you tap any switch. Audio will still be enabled during the scan, resulting in "blips" as signals go by.

· If a signal of interest shows up in the scanned range, either visually or audibly, you may wish to stop the scan and tune the signal in. Note: weak signals may be audible without showing a visual indication.

· If you use this feature frequently, consider assigning the PAN MODE menu entry to one of the user-programmable functions.

## POWER-ON BANNER

Using the KH1 Utility software application, you can customize your KH1 by adding a name and/or call sign to be displayed briefly when the KH1 is turned on. Up to 16 characters can be displayed.

This feature is especially useful if multiple KH1 users are present for an event, since this (and the serial number menu entry) may be the only way to tell KH1s apart.

## USER-PROGRAMMABLE FUNCTIONS

Menu entries PF1 FUNC , PF2 FUNC , and PF3 FUNC can be used to assign menu entries to userprogrammable functions PF1, PF2, and PF3. Once assigned to menu entries, these three functions can be accessed by first holding the PFn/XMTR switch, then tapping 1 , 2 , or 3 .

When a PFn function is assigned, a 3character version of the menu entry name replaces the original PFn label. This serves as a reminder of the menu entry. These 3-character shorthand labels are shown in the menu listing.

Example: Using PF1 as a DISP MODE short-cut

To set up PF1 to access MENU:DISP MODE :

· Hold MENU , then use the AF/MON knob to locate the PF1 FUNC menu entry.

· Use the VFO knob to change the PF1 FUNC parameter to DISP MODE.

· Exit the menu.

Having set up PF1, you can now use it as a short cut:

· Hold PFn/XMTR . Line 1 will now show 4 tap options: DSP PF2 PF3 [x ]. (Note that DSP , the 3-character shorthand name for DISP MODE, has replaced PF1 .)

· Tap 1 to switch display modes. This restores the normal display, except line 2 of the LCD will now show V/I/Temp info.

Using a PFn function that's assigned to a "binary" (2-valued) menu parameter selects the alternate value, then restores the normal display. For menu entries with more than two values, a PFn function will enter and remain in the menu.

## REAL-TIME CLOCK

The real-time clock is useful for logging, whether on paper or using the KH1's built-in logging function ( MENU:LOGGING ), which automatically time- and date-stamps transmitted text.

Time is shown as HH:MM on line 2, if MENU:DISP MODE is set to Operate.

To view or set the time (HH:MM:SS), use MENU:ADJ TIME . To view or set the date, use MENU:ADJ DATE . Long-term RTC error correction is possible using MENU:ADJ RTC .

## CUSTOMIZING POWER LEVELS

The factory-set levels for LO and HI power are about 2 W and 5 W, respectively. These can be changed using MENU:ADJ PWR.

The KH1 does not use ALC (automatic transmit level control). Actual power output will vary with load SWR and supply voltage.

The recommended HI power level is 5 W into 50 ohms when running from an 11.0 V supply or battery pack. Higher levels may be possible on some bands, but this may compromise the CW keying envelope or increase PA device heating.

The recommended LO power level is 2 W minimum. Below this level, SWR readings may be artificially low.

ATU tunes use an average of the LO and HI power settings, i.e. approximately 3.5 W if LO = 2.0 W and HI = 5.0 W.

If any transmit measurement is excessive, including current, reflected power, or temperature, the KH1 will automatically drop to the low power level. If this does not decrease the readings sufficiently, transmit will be exited.

## TEXT DECODE AND DISPLAY

When text decode is enabled for either transmit or receive, it is displayed on line 2 of the LCD as it comes in. After a period of inactivity, the regular line 2 display will be restored.

## Transmit Text Decode

The KH1 can decode and display your transmitted keying, assuming you're using the built-in keyer. To enable this, set MENU:TEXT DEC to any setting other than OFF. Use The TX-ONLY setting if you don't need to decode received CW.

If automatic logging is turned on, but TEXT DEC is set to OFF, the TEXT DEC setting is internally treated as TX-ONLY. This is necessary to decode and log your transmitted text.

## Receive Text Decode

Moderate to strong received CW signals can be decoded and displayed. In this case set MENU:TEXT DEC to TX & RX.

A tuning indicator appears to the right of the mode letter: ^ if a signal is present; _ if no signal.

Decoding performance will vary with signal strength, interference, and signal-to-noise level. For best results use the narrowest filter (FL1).

## CW/SSB CROSS-MODE OPERATION

If you set the KH1's operating mode to LSB or USB, you can copy SSB signals, but transmit will still occur as CW. This is referred to as "crossmode" operation. Cross-mode is used by QRP stations to log into nets, or to make contacts on HF Pack calling frequencies, particularly 18157.5 kHz. It could also be used in an emergency.

When operating cross-mode, SSB listeners will hear your CW signal as a tone at your selected sidetone pitch.

## GENERAL COVERAGE RECEIVE

Thanks to its electronically tuned RF band-pass filter, the KH1 provides general coverage from 6.7 to 22.0 MHz via a separate SWL band. This band can be selected using BAND/MODE . It's just above 15 meters in the rotation.

SWL is an abbreviation for S hort w ave L istening.

All KH1 operating modes are available on SWL bands. To copy AM signals, use LSB or USB mode. Sometimes interference from an adjacent AM signal can be greatly reduced by switching to the other sideband.

RIT and XIT are disabled on the SWL band. Instead, the RIT/XIT offset value is replaced with SWL as a reminder.

## Improving General-Coverage Sensitivity

During factory calibration, the RF bandpass filter (BPF) is optimized only on ham bands. SWL values are set to approximate defaults.

You can manually optimize general-coverage frequency segments of interest if required. To do this: (1) Connect an antenna (a long random wire is ideal). (2) Select the SWL band. (3) Tune the VFO to the middle of a 100 kHz segment of interest. (4) Use MENU:ADJ BPF to peak the received signal or noise.

Although transmit and automatic antenna tuning are not allowed when using the SWL band, you can optionally peak up received signals with the ATU using MENU:ATU PARAM . (This is discussed further at MANUALLY TUNING THE ATU, pg. 23.)

If you're using a wire that's ¼ wavelength or longer on the target frequency, receive sensitivity will generally be adequate without peaking the ATU. In this case you can simply bypass the ATU using MENU:ATU MODE .

## MANUALLY TUNING THE ATU

You can directly view and change the automatic antenna tuner's settings using the ATU PARAM menu entry. L and C values are shown, and each can be independently moved up or down using the VFO knob. The impedance-selection setting (Z) can also be viewed/changed.

This feature is useful for peaking receive signals without transmitting. When operating in ham bands, it's much faster to let the ATU do the work by tapping the ATU switch. But transmit is not allowed when using the SWL band, so manual adjustment of the ATU is the only option.

Typically the C (capacitance) value would be set to 0 and the inductance varied until a peak is found. Then, if further optimization of signal strength is desired, some capacitance is inserted. When capacitance is non-zero, both the LO and HI impedance settings (Z) should be tried.

For further details see MENU:ATU PARAM .

## AMPERE-HOUR METERING

The KH1's Ah reading is shown as part of the VBAT menu display. This is useful for testing battery packs, estimating remaining battery charge, or tracking the Ah needed to complete one or more objectives (e.g., a certain number of QSOs at a given power level). The value is preserved on power-off, so it can show amp hours used over multiple operating sessions.

Holding CLR resets the value to 0.000; this is typically done after swapping in a fresh battery.

## BUILT-IN LOGGING

The KH1 can log your transmitted CW in EEPROM as a backup or as an alternative to paper logging. Up to 50,000 characters can be captured, along with time, date, band, and mode, so you can update a paper or electronic logbook later on.

To enable logging, set MENU:LOGGING to ON. A letter 'L' will slowly flash to the right of the mode letter (VFO line 1). Logging applies only when using the internal keyer. To take advantage of time stamping, set the built-in clock's time and date ( MENU:ADJ TIME and MENU:ADJ DATE ).

Transmitted CW is logged in UPPER CASE . Nontransmit CW is logged in lower case . See ENTERING TEXT NOTES USING CW, below.

If you assign MENU:LOGGING to a PFn function it will alternate between the ON and VIEW settings. This is useful for reviewing QSOs.

For details on viewing, erasing, and downloading log data to a computer, refer to MENU:LOGGING .

## ENTERING TEXT NOTES USING CW

There are times when it is useful to enter nontrasmitted text into the built-in log. For example, suppose you call a station by sending only your own callsign. Tapping MSG temporarily enters TX TEST mode so you can enter the other station's callsign into the log using the keyer paddle. You can also enter field notes about locations, etc.

## INITIALIZING PARAMETERS (EEINIT)

The KH1 has 1 kbyte of EEPROM (non-volatile) memory dedicated to configuration storage. This includes calibration data, menu settings etc.

If configuration data is compromised, you can reset it to defaults using MENU:EE INIT .

The EE INIT menu entry can be used to reinitialize ALL of the KH1's stored parameters, or just the OPERATIONAL parameters. Refer to the menu entry for detailed instructions.

If a full EE INIT is done, factory calibration settings will be lost, making a full recalibration necessary. Try an OPERATIONAL EE INIT first.

## UPDATING FIRMWARE

There are two reasons to update the KH1's firmware:

· the KH1 failed its power-up test of the microcontroller firmware, and is displaying UTILITY? on the LCD

· there's new firmware available with features or bug fixes of interest

## To update firmware:

First, unplug the keyer paddle. Then run our KH1 Utility program, available on our KH1 web page.

If the KH1 is displaying UTILITY? , then it will already be configured to use the KXUSB cable, ready for KH1 Utility to be run. The utility will prompt you to begin the firmware download process.

If you're doing a normal firmware update, locate the KEY JACK menu entry and change the setting to RS232. Then run KH1 Utility and follow the instructions in its help function.

In both cases, the KH1 will show LOADING on line 1, and a progress bar on line 2 during firmware load.

## FORCED DOWNLOAD

If you can't operate the KH1 because of a "hang" condition, try initiating a forced firmware load.

To do this, hold the 2 switch while turning the KH1 on. This should force it into the boot loader, where it will show UTILITY? You can then proceed as explained above.

## CONFIGURATION LOAD/SAVE

KH1 Utility can be used to save and re-load your KH1's menu settings, per-band frequencies, ATU tuning parameters, etc. Refer to the help information within KH1 Utility for instructions.

## REMOTE CONTROL

The KH1 supports full remote control of its user interface. This capability is primarily intended for updating firmware and for automated factory alignment. But it could also be used to operate the radio using custom software, in applications ranging from controlling a KH1 in a backpack to putting the rig at an antenna's feed point.

For further information on remote control, please refer to the KH1 Programmer's Reference .

## COMPUTER INTERFACE

The KH1 is remote-controlled through its KEY/DATA jack using a KXUSB cable and a terminal emulator or software application. MENU:KEY JACK must be set to RS232. The serial interface baud rate is 9600 baud (fixed).

When the KEY/DATA jack is being used for remote control, it is not available for use with a keyer paddle or hand key. However, there's a host command (HK) that can be used to simulate CW keying, as if using a hand key. This is used during manual or factory alignment procedures, but it could be used for CW transmission, replacing the key or keyer paddle. The software application would be responsible for ASCII to CW translation and/or could provide a keying input device.

## CONFIGURATION

Numerous menu entries are provided to personalize your KH1. These are set to typical default values at the factory.

The menu entries most often modified by KH1 users are listed below. If you change a value frequently, consider assigning the associated menu entry to a programmable function switch.

## ALIGNMENT

Alignment of the KH1's transmitter and receiver is done by the factory. If you have suitable test equipment and want to touch up any of the parameters on your own, be sure to perform the alignment steps in the order listed below.

## RECEIVER

· Calibrate the synthesizer reference frequency ( MENU:ADJ REF ).

· Optimize BFO frequency for filter FL2 for best sensitivity ( MENU:ADJ BFO ).

· Set the onset of AGC action at the mixer ( MENU:ADJ AGC ).

· Maximize receive sensitivity (MENU:ADJ BPF) at 7.05, 7.15, 7.25, 10.0, 14.0, 18.0, and 21.0 MHz. Then duplicate the 10.0 setting at 10.1; duplicate the 14.0 setting at 14.1/.2/.3; duplicate the 18.0 setting at 18.1; duplicate the 21.0 setting at 21.1/.2/.3/.4. NOTE: BPF alignment of the general coverage (SWL) band is optional, and can be done at specific 100 kHz segments of interest.

· Calibrate the S-meter ( MENU:ADJ SMTR ).

## TRANSMITTER

The first two steps below require that the front panel be removed.

· Set PA bias current ( MENU:ADJ BIAS ).

· Null the SWR bridge trimmer capacitor ( MENU:ADJ SWR ).

· Calibrate the watt meter ( MENU:ADJ WMTR ).

· Calibrate the low- and high-power settings ( MENU:ADJ PWR ).

## MENU FUNCTIONS

Menu entries are shown in alphanumeric order in the table below.

MANY MENU ENTRIES ARE LOCKED to prevent accidental parameter changes. This is indicated by a key symbol at the right end of the lower LCD row. To unlock, hold switch 4 .

Each entry has a regular name used in the menu, plus a 3-character shorthand name in braces, e.g. {AGC}. Shorthand names are used as a tag for user-programmable functions (see pg. 21). They're also used with the KH1's "MN" remote-control command, which opens the selected menu entry. Refer to the Elecraft KH1 Programmer's Reference for details.


| MENU ENTRY & DEFAULT   | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ADJ AGC V {AGC}        | Sets onset of AGC action by adjusting DC bias at the base of transistor Q10. Unlock the ADJ AGC V menu entry. With no signal at the antenna jack, adjust the parameter until the AGC DC voltage shown on line 2 (typically 1.3 to 1.4 V) drops by about .02 to .03 V. On power-up, AGC voltage may take 1 - 5 s to stabilize near 1.3~1.4 V.                                                     |
| ADJ BFO                | Used to optimize BFO frequencies. IMPORTANT NOTE ON CW MODE: if the sidetone pitch is changed (from 500 Hz), we suggest re-aligning the BFO for both FL1 and FL2. This is not necessary for FL3, or for the filters used in SSB modes. BFO adjustment does not the affect actual receive frequency of the KH1, because the BFO is taken into account when the local oscillator frequency (LO) is |

Note: The KH1 can optionally show a banner on power-up (name, call, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| SW TONES {SWT} OFF TEXT DEC {TXT} OFF | When set to ON, the KH1 will emit switch-event acknowledgement tones. When set to TX ONLY , the KH1 will decode outgoing CW sent with a keyer paddle plugged into the KEY/DATA jack. When set to TX & RX , the KH1 will incoming CW as well. Receive decode works best with moderate to strong signals (S6 or higher).               |
| VBAT {VBT}                            | This menu entry shows two useful measurements: · LCD line 1: internal battery voltage (assuming a KHIBC1 module is installed).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

NOTE: The voltage shown here is a more accurate reading of the internal battery than the "V/I/Temp" display ( MENU:DISP MODE ). For example, if the internal battery voltage is 12.0 V, it will read about 11.8 V using the V/I/Temp display, due to an internal supply/battery "wire-ORing" diode. But it will read 12.0 V in the VBAT menu entry, since this measurement occurs on the battery side of the diode. The VBAT voltage reading also remains accurate when an external power supply is plugged in for charging. For further details, see pg. 23.   |

| VFO FAST {FST} 100 Hz | Specifies the VFO step size that's in effect when the frequency display shows only one decimal place. (When two decimal places are displayed, the tuning rate is 10 Hz; when none are displayed, the rate is 1 kHz.) Since the VFO knob has a small diameter, a VFO FAST setting of 200 Hz (or even higher) may be a pragmatic choice even for CW operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## TROUBLESHOOTING

## GENERAL

· UTILITY? shown on LCD : Do a forced firmware load (pg. 24).

· ERR (error) message displayed : Refer to ERROR MESSAGES (pg. 36).

· BAT LOW flashes: Check the battery voltage (see MENU:DISP MODE and MENU:VBAT ).

· Can't turn power on: Check power cable, or make sure a battery pack is plugged in and charged.

· KXUSB cable keys TX: MENU:KEY JACK must be set to RS232 when this cable is plugged in.

· VFO frequency or other parameters not saved on power-down: The KH1 only updates changed settings when a switch is pressed - not continuously, and not automatically on power-down.

· General problem with transmit and/or receive: Many problems can be caused by low power supply voltage or by a noisy or intermittent supply. Check your power supply's on/off switch, voltage, fuses (if applicable), and DC cabling. The KH1 provides voltage and current monitoring (see MENU:DISP MODE ). Also see TRANSMIT and RECEIVE troubleshooting sections, below.

· General problem with firmware behavior: (1) Check all menu settings (see previous section). (2) Try loading the latest KH1 firmware. Review release notes.

· Not Applicable message : The function in use doesn't apply in the present context.

· Not Implemented message : The function you're trying to use has not yet been implemented.

· Letter L flashes slowly near mode letter : This is a reminder that logging is on ( MENU:LOGGING ).

· Letter L (for logging) does not flash when expected : When CW received text decode is enabled (MENU:TEXT DEC) , its tuning indicator character overrides the flashing L for logging.

· Letter r flashes slowly near mode letter : Message repeat is in progress.

· VFO frequency doesn't change: The VFO may be locked. Use BAND/MODE -> 4 to unlock.

## TRANSMIT

· Keyer paddle is reversed: The first version of the KHPD1 paddle (with green PC board) was wired backwards from the newer version (with black PC board). Set MENU:KEY JACK as required.

· Keyer paddle not secure : If the paddle wobbles or adds extra elements when keying, it is probably not fully plugged into the KEY jack. Be sure to push it all the way into the jack until you feel a snap. Plastic nubs to the left and right of the jack should then preventing it from rotating.

· Whip mounting post slightly loose: This is normal. See explanation at top of pg. 10.

· Can't transmit: (1) Make sure the key or keyer paddle is plugged in. (2) Make sure MENU:KEY JACK is not set to RS232. (3) Turn off TX TEST mode if applicable ( PFn/XMTR -> TST ).

· Low power output: Check battery voltage. You may also be working into a high-SWR load and/or using a low supply voltage. The KH1 does not use ALC to maintain constant power output, so high SWR may result in reduced power. Note: Max power also varies per band.

· BND END warning: Indicates an attempt to transmit outside the ham bands.

· HI CUR or HI SWR warning : Check supply voltage. If voltage is low and/or a low-impedance antenna load is present, current can go up for a given requested power level. Reduce power if necessary. (The KH1 may do this automatically. If this doesn't reduce the current or reflected power to safe levels, the KH1 will drop out of transmit mode.)

· HI TEMP warning : PA heat sink temperature has exceeded the safe operating limit. Set display line 2 mode to V/I/Temp using MENU:DISP MODE . The normal display will then show power supply voltage, current drain, and PA temperature. Allow heat sink to cool. Reduce power if necessary. (The KH1 may reduce power, drop out of transmit mode, or turn itself off.)

· Top cover is hot to the touch: The top cover sheet metal provides part of the KH1's PA heat sinking, so it it normal for it to feel quite warm during long transmissions. The panel will run cooler if you use shorter transmissions, lower power, or a lower supply voltage.

## RECEIVE

· Internal speaker clipping / distortion: The KH1's small internal speaker is not intended for use in high-noise environments, such as in a noisy vehicle or outdoors in high winds. If audible artifacts occur, reduce AF gain or switch to headphones (or use an external powered speaker).

· No received signal, or signal too low: Check all of the following: (1) antenna connectors; (2) attenuator setting; (3) AF gain setting; (4) whip slide switch setting (may be in center-off position); (5) headphone plug.

· Audio noise drops briefly after large QSY: The synthesizer IC used in the KH1 does internal recalibration after the VFO moves a certain distance (50-150 kHz). This brief transition may be perceived as a short audio dropout.

· Opposite-sideband images heard: Some received opposite-sideband (OSB) signal will always be heard on strong signals with a 4-crystal filter. The amount varies with filter bandwidth; suppression will be best with setting FL1. With strong signals, AGC reduces their audio level when tuned in, but not when tuned to the OSB image, reducing apparent OSB suppression.

· Mobile installation noise: If the 12 V DC accessory jack in a vehicle causes interference to the KH1's receiver: (1) improve vehicle's DC filtering; (2) use a battery; (3) relocate the antenna.

· HI RFI warning : The KH1 protects itself from high signal levels. First the -10 dB attenuator is inserted (if attenuation was set to 0 dB). The second step, if necessary, is to insert the -30 dB attenuator. Once signals return to a safe level for 5 seconds, the attenuator will be turned off.

## THEORY OF OPERATION

Please refer to the block diagram on the next page.

## Receiver

The KH1's receiver uses a low-current superhet architecture with a 9.215 MHz I.F. This frequency provides a good balance between crystal filter performance and image rejection. The mixer's noise figure is low enough to preclude the use of an RF preamp. A two-stage RF attenuator is provided for strong-signal situations.

Local oscillator signals for both the LO and BFO are synthesized by a specialized IC that generates signals in the GHz range, then divides them down to HF. This provides both fine resolution and low phase noise. High-side mixer injection (above the low-pass filter cutoff) is used on all five bands (40-15 m), again for the purpose of improving image rejection.

Audio-derived AGC is developed out of the AF preamp stage, then DC-amplified by a darlington transistor. The resulting voltage is applied to pin 1 of both the mixer and product detector, resulting in a very usable AGC range.

The class-AB final audio amp stage uses analog electronic gain control so it can be adjusted by the MCU. The gain control voltage is generated by a DAC (D-to-A converter) channel. The amp can drive the small speaker to about 0.5 W peak.

## Transmitter

The same IC that generates receive LO and BFO also generates the TX carrier frequency during transmit. This is amplified by an NPN driver stage, then fed to a VHF MOSFET TO-220 package transistor biased class AB to ensure good gain and power output from 7 to 15 MHz.

Power output is controlled by driver bias. The driver's keying output wave shape is generated by a PNP high-side integrator to prevent key clicks.

Low-pass filter and ATU relays are latching to reduce total current drain.

## Control circuits and signal processing

All transceiver control functions are controlled by a PIC18 microcontroller. The MCU also handles signal some processing functions: (1) sidetone generation; (2) CW text decode; (3) spectral analysis to drive the mini-pan display; (4) audio signal detection and averaging, for the S-meter and other purposes.

TR switching is handled by a MOSFET switch.

Supplemental circuits include voltage, current and temperature monitoring; a 32 K EEPROM for decoded TX text logging; and a real-time clock IC (RTC).

## Elecraft 1-Year Limited Warranty

This warranty is effective as of the date of first consumer purchase (or if shipped from the factory, the date the product is shipped to the customer). It covers both our kits and fully assembled products. For kits, before requesting warranty service, you should fully complete the assembly, carefully following all instructions in the manual.

Who is covered: This warranty covers the original owner of the Elecraft product as disclosed to Elecraft at the time of order. Elecraft products transferred by the purchaser to a third party, either by sale, gift, or other method, who is not disclosed to Elecraft at the time of original order, are not covered by this warranty. If the Elecraft product is being bought indirectly for a third party, the third party's name and address must be provided at time of order to ensure warranty coverage.

What is covered: During the first year after date of purchase, Elecraft will replace defective or missing parts free of charge (post-paid). We will also correct any malfunction to kits or assembled units caused by defective parts and materials. Purchaser pays inbound shipping to us for warranty repair; we pay shipping to return the repaired equipment to you by UPS ground service or equivalent to the continental USA and Canada. For Alaska, Hawaii, and other destinations outside the U.S. and Canada, actual return shipping cost is paid by the owner.

What is not covered: This warranty does not cover correction of kit assembly errors. It also does not cover misalignment; repair of damage caused by misuse, negligence, battery leakage or corrosion, or builder modifications; or any performance malfunctions involving non-Elecraft accessory equipment. The use of acid-core solder, water-soluble flux solder, or any corrosive or conductive flux or solvent will void this warranty in its entirety. Also not covered is reimbursement for loss of use, inconvenience, customer assembly or alignment time, or cost of unauthorized service.

Limitation of incidental or consequential damages: This warranty does not extend to non-Elecraft equipment or components used in conjunction with our products. Any such repair or replacement is the responsibility of the customer. Elecraft will not be liable for any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited to any loss of business or profit
